# Compute Unused (Quarantine)

This folder contains deprecated or no-evidence shaders moved out of active compute stages.

## Usage rules

- Do not add new runtime references to this folder.
- Keep entries here until deprecation decisions are finalized.
- Remove files only after confirming no direct or indirect runtime/test references remain.
