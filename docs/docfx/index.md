# XRENGINE API Reference

This DocFX site is generated from the C# projects in `XRENGINE.sln` and surfaces XML summaries for every public class, struct, interface, and enum. Use it alongside the hand-written guides in `docs/` to navigate systems and cross-reference types while developing or reviewing changes.

- The landing page is kept lightweight; use the left navigation or search to jump directly to namespaces and types.
- Links to the GitHub repository appear on each page so you can move from documentation to source quickly.
- The build picks up XML doc comments emitted during compilation; keep summaries up to date to improve the generated reference.
