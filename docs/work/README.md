# Work Docs

In-flight design notes, investigations, and backlogs. These change frequently; prefer stable overviews in the main docs index when onboarding.

## Backlog & Checklists
- [Project TODO](backlog/todo.md)
- [Warnings Remediation Checklist](backlog/warnings-todo.md)
- [Vulkan TODO](backlog/VULKAN_TODO.md)
- [Indirect GPU Rendering TODO](backlog/IndirectGPURendering-TODO.md)

## Design & Investigations
- [Indirect GPU Rendering Architecture](design/IndirectGPURendering-Design.md)
- [Vulkan Parity Report](design/vulkan-parity-report.md)
- [Vulkan Command Buffer Refactor](design/vulkan-command-buffer-refactor.md)
- [GPU Physics Chain Compatibility](design/gpu-physics-chain-compatibility.md)
- [GPU Physics Chain Engine Verification](design/gpu-physics-chain-engine-verification.md)

## Notes
- Treat these documents as working areas for active refactors and planning.
- If you promote a design to shipped behavior, mirror key details into the relevant API or architecture doc.
